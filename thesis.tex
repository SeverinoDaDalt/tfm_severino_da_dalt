\agraiments{
    This journey would not have been possible without the support, encouragement, and patience of many incredible people.
    The list that follows is by no means exhaustive, but it is a heartfelt attempt to recognize some of the individuals
    who have been crucial in this chapter of my life.

    First and foremost, I want to express my deepest gratitude to Huichao. Her unwavering emotional support has been
    my anchor through these years.
    More than that, her invaluable and constant support in all other aspects of our life created the foundation upon
    which this work was built, allowing me the peace and focus required to complete this thesis.
    I am eternally grateful for everything.

    I owe a huge thank you to my Master's colleague and gym buddy, Ferran. Our countless discussions on everything
    from mathematics to philosophy, the infinite hours studying together, and the help and fun you shared with me made
    this entire adventure both manageable and memorable.

    My sincere thanks go to my university colleagues—Fritz, Jorge, Sandra, Oriol, and many others.
    We fought through the struggles together and celebrated the amazing moments, and I am grateful to have shared this
    experience with you all.
    I also want to thank the \say{Nice Questers}—Pau, Diego, Arnau, Mario, Rubén, and Narcís—for welcoming me and
    making my move to Spain one of the best changes of my life.
    A sincere thank you also to my colleagues, Iñigo, Valle, and the rest of the team. Your support have been a huge part
    of this journey.

    A very special thanks to my family. Without your unconditional love and support,
    I probably would not be where I am today.
    Your belief in me has always been a source of strength.

    Last but certainly not least, I want to thank my supervisor, Lluís Vena.
    I am immensely grateful for the insane amount of hours you dedicated to assisting me, for your patience, for always
    being open to any suggestion, and for the many hours we spent debating whether something was, in fact,
    redundant or not.
    Your guidance has been invaluable.}
