\section{Section 2} \label{sec:section_2}
    \todo{Things that should be included in this section:
        - General notation.
        - Definition of a graph.
        - Probably, also present edges as a relation on vertices, mentioning its properties, and explain
            that this is the bridge with model theory.
        - Define density of a (non necessarily disjoint) pair of sets of vertices.
        - Definition of a bipartite graph.
        - Reglarity definitions.
        - Szemer\'edi's regularity lemma.
    }

    \todo{Notation:
        - By abuse of notation $a R b$ is a value in $\parcurly{0,1}$.
        - Abuse of notation: $a \in G$ to say that $a \in V(G)$.
        - $\partriangle{\cdot}$ to represent tuples.
