\section{Section 2} \label{sec:section_2}
    \todo{Things that should be included in this section: \\
        - General notation. \\
        - Definition of a graph. \\
        - Probably, also present edges as a relation on vertices, mentioning its properties, and explain
            that this is the bridge with model theory. \\
        - Define density of a (non necessarily disjoint) pair of sets of vertices. \\
        - Definition of a bipartite graph. \\
        - Reglarity definitions. \\
        - Szemer\'edi's regularity lemma.
    }

    \todo{Notation:
        - By abuse of notation $a R b$ is a value in $\parcurly{0,1}$. \\
        - Abuse of notation: $a \in G$ to say that $a \in V(G)$. \\
        - $\Partriangle{\cdot}$ to represent tuples.
    }

    \todo{Mention that during the thesis, a lot of results carry many conditions most of which seem almost trivial,
        but are necessary for the computations to work. In the final result of each section, the results are cleaned out
        and tried to be delivered in a more readable form.}
