\section{Property testing} \label{sec:section_6}

    This section is dedicated at showcasing the benefits of the stable regularity lemma regarding its partition size
    and lack of irregular pairs, by giving a concrete application in property testing.
    More specifically we focus at studying $H$-freeness in stable graphs.
    We now formalize some key concepts that were loosely defined in the introduction.

    \begin{definition}
        We say that a graph $G$ is \emph{$\epsilon$-far} from satisfying a graph property $\mathcal{P}$ if no adding or
        removing of up to $\epsilon {|G| \choose 2}$ edges in $G$ results in the graph satisfying the property.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition} \label{def:epsilon_test}
        An \emph{$\epsilon$-test} $\mathcal{A}$ deciding a graphs property $\mathcal{P}$ with query complexity
        $q(n)$ is a randomized algorithm that, on input graph $G$ of size $n$,
        satisfies the following.
        \begin{enumerate}[label={\Roman*}., ref={\Roman*}, font=\rmfamily]
            \item If $G \in \mathcal{P}$, then $\mathbb{P}\parround{\mathcal{A} \text{ accepts } G} \geq \frac{2}{3}$.
            \item If $G$ is $\epsilon$-far from satisfying $\mathcal{P}$,
                then $\mathbb{P}\parround{\mathcal{A} \text{ rejects } G} \geq \frac{2}{3}$.
        \end{enumerate}
        The query complexity $q(n)$ is the maximum number of queries the algorithm can make, and (in our case)
        a query discerns whether a desired pair of vertices in the input graph $G$ is adjacent or not.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}
        We say that a property $\mathcal{P}$ is \emph{testable} if there exists an $\epsilon$-test deciding $\mathcal{P}$
        with a constant query-complexity with respect to the size of the input graph, that is, it only depends on the
        parameter $\epsilon$.
    \end{definition}

    The remaining of this section is dedicated to the construction of an $\epsilon$-test for $H$-freeness in stable graphs.
    Such an $\epsilon$-test needs to be able to distinguish between graphs that are $H$-free and graphs that
    are $\epsilon$-far from it, with some error.
    In fact, our $\epsilon$-test will only have one-sided error, as if the input graph is $H$-free the tester will report so
    with probability $1$.

    The first step towards constructing such tester is proving \Cref{thm:property_testing_with_stable_partitions}.
    This theorem uses the Stable Regularity Lemma to prove that if a graph is $\epsilon$-far
    from being $H$-free then it contains many induced copies of $H$ (at least a fraction of all induced subgraphs of size $|H|$).
    This point is central for the construction, and once proved we can simply let the tester ask for all the edges
    in a sample of vertices of fixed size.
    The algorithm then simply checks whether a copy of $H$ can be found in the subgraph induced by the sample, and report
    accordingly.

    \subsection{Unavoidable is abundant} \label{subsec:subsection_6.1}

        We now briefly formalize the concepts of being far from $H$-freeness, and containing many copies of $H$ using the
        notation from~\cite{efficient_testing_of_large_graphs}.

        \begin{definition} \label{def:unavoidable}
            A graph $H$ is \emph{$\gamma$-unavoidable} in a graph $G$ if no adding or removing of up to $\gamma {|G| \choose 2}$
            edges in $G$ results in $H$ not appearing as an induced subgraph of $G$.
        \end{definition}

        \begin{definition} \label{def:abundant}
            A graph $H$ is \emph{$\eta$-abundant} in a graph $G$ if $G$ contains at least $\eta |G|^{|H|}$
            induced copies of $H$.
        \end{definition}

        An important property of regularity, which is needed for the proof of the theorem, is that the regularity is
        partially maintained when moving to subsets.
        Not only that, but it also ensures that the density of the pair does not change too much.

        \begin{lemma}[Lemma 3.1 in~\cite{efficient_testing_of_large_graphs}] \label{lem:regularity_is_transitive}
            Let $\epsilon \leq \epsilon' < \frac{1}{2}$ and $\delta \in \parround{0, 1}$.
            If $\parround{A,B}$ is an (not necessarily disjoint) $\epsilon$-regular pair with density $\delta$, $A' \subseteq A$ with
            $A \geq \epsilon' |A|$, and $B' \subseteq B$ with $|B'| \geq \epsilon' |B|$, then $\parround{A', B'}$ is an
            $\parround{\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon'}}$-regular pair with density at least $\delta - \epsilon$ and at most $\delta + \epsilon$.
            \begin{proof}
                Let $A'' \subseteq A' \subseteq A$, $B'' \subseteq B' \subseteq B$ be such that
                \begin{align*}
                    |A''| & \geq \frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon'} |A'| \geq \frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon'} \epsilon' |A| = \epsilon |A|
                    \text{ and } \\
                    |B''| & \geq \frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon'} |B'| \geq \frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon'} \epsilon' |B| = \epsilon |B|.
                \end{align*}
                By $\epsilon$-regularity of $\parround{A,B}$, $\parstraight{d(A,B) - d(A'',B'')} < \epsilon$.
                Thus,
                \begin{align*}
                    \parstraight{d(A',B') - d(A'',B'')}
                        & = \parstraight{d(A',B') - d(A,B) + d(A,B) - d(A'',B'')} \\
                        & \leq \parstraight{d(A',B') - d(A,B)} + \parstraight{d(A,B) - d(A'',B'')} \\
                        & < 2 \epsilon \leq \frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon'}.
                \end{align*}
                This proves the $\parround{\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon'}}$-regularity of $\parround{A',B'}$.

                Also, since $\parround{A,B}$ is $\epsilon$-regular, $\parstraight{d(A,B) - d(A',B')} < \epsilon$,
                and thus,
                \[
                    \delta - \epsilon < d(A',B') < \delta + \epsilon.
                \]
            \end{proof}
        \end{lemma}

        In the context of the regularity method, the \emph{reduced graph} $H$ associated to a partition
        $\parcurly{A_1, \dots, A_m}$ of a graph $A$, is a graph (possibly with loops) with $m$ vertices $v_1, \dots, v_m$
        such that for all (not necessarily distinct) $i,j \in \parcurly{1, \dots, m}$, it satisfies that $v_i R v_j$
        if and only if $d(A_i, A_j) > T$, for some threshold value $T \in [0,1)$.
        Since pairs of parts in a stable regular partition are almost empty or almost full, any threshold value
        in $\parround{\epsilon, 1 - \epsilon}$ associates \emph{almost full} pairs with edges, and \emph{almost empty}
        pairs with non-edges.
        In particular, one may consider $T = 1/2$.

        The pivotal point in the proof of \Cref{thm:property_testing_with_stable_partitions} is the fact that, if the
        reduced graph from a regular partition contains a copy of $H$ as an induced subgraph, and all edges
        lie in regular pairs, then the original graph contains many induced copies of $H$
        (this is a version of the so called \emph{Counting Lemma}
        from~\cite{the_regulariy_lemma_and_its_applications_in_graph_theory}).
        The following lemma formalizes this idea.

        \begin{lemma}[Lemma 3.2 in~\cite{efficient_testing_of_large_graphs}] \label{lem:H_like_partition_implies_H_abundance}
            For every real number $\delta \in \parround{0, 1}$ and integer $\ell > 0$ there exist $\epsilon = \epsilon \parround{\delta, \ell}$ and
            $\eta = \eta \parround{\delta, \ell}$ satisfying the following property:

            Let $H$ be a graph with vertices $v_1, \dots,v_\ell$ and let $V_1, \dots, V_\ell$ be an $\ell$-tuple of (not necessarily disjoint)
            sets of vertices of a graph $G$ such that for every $1 \leq i < i' \leq \ell$, the pair $\parround{V_i, V_{i'}}$
            is $\epsilon$-regular, with density at least $\delta$ if $v_i v_{i'}$ is an edge of $H$, and at most $1 - \delta$
            if $v_i v_{i'}$ is not an edge of $H$.
            Then, at least $\eta \prod_{i=1}^\ell \parstraight{V_i}$ of $\ell$-tuples $w_1 \in V_1, \dots, w_\ell \in V_\ell$
            span induced copies of $H$ where $w_i$ plays the role of $v_i$.
            \begin{proof}
                Without loss of generality, we assume that $H$ is the complete graph, since we can simply replace each non-edge
                $v_i v_{i'}$ of $H$ with an edge by exchanging all edges and non-edges between $V_i$ and $V_{i'}$.

                We prove the lemma by induction on $\ell$.
                The case $\ell=1$ is trivial, and the number of induced copies of $H$ is $|V_1|$, so $\eta(\delta, 1) = 1$ and
                $\epsilon(\delta, 1) = 1$ (No regularity needed if no pairs).
                The I.H. is that the values $\eta(\delta, \ell-1)$ and $\epsilon(\delta, \ell-1)$ exist and are known for all
                $\ell$.
                We proceed to prove that the following values $\eta$ and $\epsilon$ hold.
                \begin{align*}
                    \epsilon &= \epsilon(\delta, \ell)
                        = \min \Parcurly{\frac{1}{2\ell - 2}, \frac{1}{2} \delta \epsilon(\frac{1}{2}\delta, \ell-1)}. \\
                    \eta &= \eta(\delta, \ell)
                        = \frac{1}{2} (\delta - \epsilon)^{\ell-1} \eta(\frac{1}{2}\delta, \ell-1).
                \end{align*}
                For each $1 < i \leq \ell$, the number of vertices of $V_1$ which have less then
                $(\delta - \epsilon) \parstraight{V_i}$ neighbors in $V_i$ is less then $\epsilon \parstraight{V_i}$.
                Otherwise, the set of such vertices, say $U \in [V_1]^{\geq \epsilon \parstraight{V_1}}$ together with $V_i$
                would form a subpair $\parround{U, V_i}$ with density $< \delta - \epsilon$ which, by
                \Cref{lem:regularity_is_transitive} contradicts the $\epsilon$-regularity of the pair $\parround{V_1, V_i}$.

                Therefore, at least $(1 - (\ell -1) \epsilon) \parstraight{V_1}$ of the vertices of $V_1$ have at least
                $(\delta - \epsilon) \parstraight{V_i}$ neighbors in $V_i$ for all $1 < i \leq \ell$.
                In particular, since $\epsilon \leq \frac{1}{2\ell - 2}$ we have that $(\ell - 1) \epsilon \leq \frac{1}{2}$
                and then $1 - (\ell - 1) \epsilon \geq \frac{1}{2}$, so at least half of the vertices of $V_1$ satisfy the
                above condition.

                For each such vertex $w_1 \in V_1$, let $V_i'$ denote the subset of vertices of $V_i$ which are neighbors
                of $w_1$.
                Since $\epsilon \leq \frac{1}{2}\delta$, \Cref{lem:regularity_is_transitive} implies that for all
                $1 < i < i' \leq \ell$, the pair $\parround{V_i', V_{i'}'}$ is $\parround{\frac{\epsilon}{\delta-\epsilon}}$-regular,
                and given that $\parround{\frac{\epsilon}{\delta-\epsilon}} \leq \parround{\frac{2\epsilon}{\delta}} \leq \epsilon\parround{\frac{1}{2}\delta, \ell-1}$,
                it is $\epsilon\parround{\frac{1}{2}\delta, \ell-1}$-regular.
                Also, it has density at least $\delta - \epsilon \geq \frac{1}{2} \delta$.
                By the induction hypothesis, we have at least
                \[
                    \eta \parround{\frac{1}{2}\delta, \ell-1} \prod_{i=2}^\ell \parstraight{V_i'}
                        \geq \eta \parround{\frac{1}{2}\delta, \ell-1} \prod_{i=2}^\ell \parround{\delta - \epsilon} \parstraight{V_i}
                \]
                possible choices of $w_2 \in V_2, \dots, w_\ell \in V_\ell$ such that the induced subgraph spanned by
                $w_1, \dots, w_\ell$ is complete.
                Since there are at least $\frac{1}{2} \parstraight{V_1}$ vertices $w_1$ which satisfy the above condition,
                the chosen values of $\eta$ satisfies the lemma, and we are done.
            \end{proof}
        \end{lemma}

        \begin{remark}
            We now give a non-recursive form of $\epsilon$ and a lower bound of $\eta$, for all $\ell \geq 1$.
            \begin{align*}
                \epsilon(\delta, \ell) & = \bbparround{\frac{1}{2}}^{\frac{\ell(\ell-1)}{2}} \cdot \delta^{\ell-1}. \\
                \eta(\delta, \ell) & \geq \bbparround{\frac{1}{2}}^{\frac{\ell^3+5\ell-6}{6}} \cdot \delta^{\frac{\ell(\ell-1)}{2}}.
            \end{align*}
        \end{remark}

        We are now ready to prove the main theorem of this section.
        The proof is similar to that of~\cite[Theorem~5.1]{efficient_testing_of_large_graphs},
        but with some major simplification and optimization allowed by using the Stable Regularity Lemma.
        The main difference is the fact that we do not need to refine the partition to get rid of irregular pairs.
        To resume, we first apply \Cref{thm:existance_of_regular_partitions} to get a regular partition,
        then, we create a copy of the graph where pairs become either complete or empty, by adding or subtracting,
        overall, less than $\gamma {|G| \choose 2}$ edges.
        By the $\gamma$-unavoidability of $H$, this new graph still contains a copy of $H$.
        This fact ensures the existence of an induced structure in the partition of the original graph which allows
        us to apply \Cref{lem:H_like_partition_implies_H_abundance} and conclude that $H$ is abundant in $G$.
        Such conclusion is formalized in the following theorem.

        \begin{theorem} \label{thm:property_testing_with_stable_partitions}
            For every $k_*, \gamma, \ell$ there is a $\eta(k_*, \gamma, \ell)$ such that if $H$ is a graph with $\ell$
            vertices, $G$ has the non-$k_*$-order property and $H$ is $\gamma$-unavoidable in $G$, then $H$ is
            $\eta$-abundant in $G$.
            \begin{proof}
                Apply \Cref{thm:existance_of_regular_partitions} to $G$ with $\epsilon = \min \Parcurly{\sqrt{\gamma},
                    \epsilon_{\ref{lem:H_like_partition_implies_H_abundance}} \parround{1 - \gamma, \ell}}$,
                $k_*$ and $m=0$.
                We have a partition $\overline{A} = \bparcurly{A_i \mid i \in \parcurly{1, \dots, m_*}}$ into $m_* \leq M$
                disjoint parts, with
                \[
                    M \leq \ceil{12 \max\Parcurly{\frac{1}{\sqrt{\gamma}}, \frac{1}{\epsilon_{\ref{lem:H_like_partition_implies_H_abundance}}
                        \parround{1 - \gamma, \ell}}}}^{2^{k_*+1}-1}
                \]
                such that all pairs of parts are $\epsilon$-regular.
                Also, by \Cref{rmk:excellence_imply_little_exceptions} and the $\frac{\epsilon^2}{2}$-excellence of the parts,
                the pairs have density at most $\epsilon^2$ or at least $1 - \epsilon^2$.

                Next, we modify the graph $G$ into $G'$ by only adding and removing no more than $\gamma {|G| \choose 2}$
                edges:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item For each pair of parts $\parround{A_{i_1}, A_{i_2}}$ with $i_1 \neq i_2$, if the pair's density is
                        at most $\epsilon^2$, we remove all edges between $A_{i_1}$ and $A_{i_2}$.
                        Otherwise, the pair's density is at least $1 - \epsilon^2$, and we add all remaining edges.
                        This changes at most a fraction $\epsilon^2$ of the edges between (disjoint) parts.
                    \item For each self-pair $\parround{A_i, A_i}$, if the pair's density is at most $\epsilon^2$, again we
                        remove all edges in $A_i$.
                        Otherwise, the pair's density is at least $1 - \epsilon^2$, and we add all remaining edges.
                        Notice that, in self-pairs, the density ($1$ minus the density respectively) is at most
                        the fraction of possible edges in the pair that actually are edges (non-edges), as noted in
                        \Cref{rmk:density_vs_real_density}.
                        Thus, the fraction of changed edges in all self-pairs is at most $\epsilon^2$.
                \end{itemize}
                The resulting graph $G'$ differs from $G$ in at most $\epsilon^2 {|G| \choose 2} \leq \gamma {|G| \choose 2}$
                edges, and satisfies that each pair of parts (disjoint or not) is either complete or empty.
                Then, the $\gamma$-unavoidability of $H$ in $G$ ensures that there is still a copy of $H$ in $G'$.
                Denote its vertices $v_{i_1}, \dots, v_{i_\ell}$, choosing $i_1, \dots, i_\ell$ such that
                $v_{i_1} \in A_{i_1}, \dots, v_{i_\ell} \in A_{i_\ell}$.

                Notice that $A_{i_1}, \dots, A_{i_\ell}$ satisfy the conditions of \Cref{lem:H_like_partition_implies_H_abundance}
                with $\delta_{\ref{lem:H_like_partition_implies_H_abundance}} = 1 - \gamma$:
                each pair $\parround{A_{i_j}, A_{i_{j'}}}$ with $j \neq j'$ is $\epsilon$-regular,
                and since $\epsilon \leq \epsilon_{\ref{lem:H_like_partition_implies_H_abundance}} \parround{1 - \gamma, \ell}$,
                in particular is $\epsilon_{\ref{lem:H_like_partition_implies_H_abundance}} \parround{1 - \gamma, \ell}$-regular.
                Hence, the lemma guarantees that there are at least $\eta_{\ref{lem:H_like_partition_implies_H_abundance}}
                    \parround{1 - \gamma, \ell} \prod_{j=1}^\ell \parcurly{A_{i_j},j}$
                copies of $H$ in $G$.

                The fraction of induced copies of $H$ in $G$ is at least
                \[
                    \frac{\eta_{\ref{lem:H_like_partition_implies_H_abundance}} \parround{1 - \gamma, \ell}
                        \prod_{j=1}^\ell \parcurly{A_{i_j}}}{n^\ell}
                        \geq \eta_{\ref{lem:H_like_partition_implies_H_abundance}} \parround{1 - \gamma, \ell}
                            \bbparround{\frac{n/M}{n}}^{\ell}
                        = \eta_{\ref{lem:H_like_partition_implies_H_abundance}} \parround{1 - \gamma, \ell}
                            \parround{M}^{-\ell}
                        \eqqcolon \eta,
                \]
                and $H$ is at least $\eta$-abundant in $G$.
            \end{proof}
        \end{theorem}

        Notice that this same result can be proved in the general context instead of only for stable graphs
        as the original Theorem 5.1 from~\cite{efficient_testing_of_large_graphs} proves.
        The difference is that the resulting $\eta$ is much larger (although not given explicitly).
        The main reasons of such an improvement, as mentioned earlier, is that neither a double partition is required to
        elude irregular pairs, neither the bound on the number of parts is a tower of powers.
        This allows the resulting set of parts $A_{i_1}, \dots, A_{i_\ell}$, the ones used as a restricted copy of $H$ in $G$
        in the previous theorem, to be a larger proportion of the whole graph, and thus inducing more copies of $H$.

        \begin{remark}
            We now provide a more explicit lower bound for $\eta$ only depending on $\gamma$, $k_*$ and $\ell$ is:
            \[
                \eta \geq \Parround{\frac{1}{2}}^{\frac{\ell^3 + 5\ell -6}{6}}
                    \cdot (1 - \gamma)^{\frac{\ell(\ell-1)}{2}}
                    \cdot \Parround{\frac{1}{24} \min\Parcurly{\sqrt{\gamma},
                        \Parround{\frac{1}{2}}^{\frac{\ell(\ell-1)}{2}} (1 - \gamma)^{\ell-1}}}^{\ell \Parround{2^{k_*+1}-1}}.
            \]
        \end{remark}

    \subsection{The algorithm} \label{subsec:subsection_6.2}

        Now we have all the tools needed to build an $\epsilon$-test $\mathcal{A}$, which decides
        $H$-freeness for a given graph $H$ of size $\ell$, in the context of graphs with the non-$k_*$-order property.

        $\mathcal{A} = \mathcal{A}(H,\epsilon,k_*)$ works as follows.
        Given a graph $H$, with all edges known, a natural number $k_*$, a real number $\epsilon$, and a graph $G$ with
        the non-$k_*$-order property, whose edges are unknown, the algorithm computes $\ell = |H|$, and the value
        $t = \frac{\ell \log\parround{\frac{2}{3}}}
            {\log\parround{1 - \eta_{\ref{thm:property_testing_with_stable_partitions}}(k_*, \epsilon, \ell)}}$.
        It then samples $t$ different vertices from $G$ uniformly at random.
        $\mathcal{A}$ queries all edges from the sampled set, and checks whether a copy of $H$ as an induced
        subgraph can be found in it.
        If a copy of $H$ is found, then $\mathcal{A}$ accepts $G$.
        Otherwise, $\mathcal{A}$ rejects it.
        See \Cref{alg:h-freeness_tester} for a more detailed step to step description of $\mathcal{A}$.

                \EndIf
            \end{algorithmic}
        \end{algorithm}

        We now proceed to prove that, indeed, $\mathcal{A}$ is an $\epsilon$-test.
        If the input graph $G$ is $H$-free, then the algorithm returns $0$, either because the graph $G$ is too small to
        contain $H$ (\cref{line:G_smaller_then_H}) or because all attempts of finding $H$ as an induced subgraph of $G$
        failed (either \cref{line:G_small_enough_not_found_H} or \cref{line:not_found_H}).
        On the other hand, if $G$ is $\epsilon$-far from being $H$-free, \Cref{thm:property_testing_with_stable_partitions}
        ensures that $H$ is $\eta_{\ref{thm:property_testing_with_stable_partitions}}(k_*, \epsilon, \ell)$-abundant in $G$.
        Thus, checking $t_*$ times whether a random sample of $\ell$ vertices contains an
        induced copy of $H$, the probability of not finding any copy of $H$ is at most
        $\parround{1 - \eta_{\ref{thm:property_testing_with_stable_partitions}}(k_*, \epsilon, \ell)}^{t_*}$.
        By letting $t_* = \frac{\log\parround{\frac{2}{3}}}
            {\log\parround{1 - \eta_{\ref{thm:property_testing_with_stable_partitions}}(k_*, \epsilon, \ell)}}$
        the probability of finding at least one copy of $H$ is at least $\frac{2}{3}$.
        The total number of vertices included in the samples is at most (as there may be repetitions) $t \coloneqq t_* \cdot \ell$.
        Hence, querying for all pairs of vertices in a random sample of $t$ vertices has strictly more probabilities of
        finding a copy of $H$ appearing as an induced subgraph of $G$.
        For completeness, we also need to ensure that $n \geq t$.
        If $n < t$, then the algorithm simply queries all edges of $G$, checks whether $H$ appears as an induced subgraph
        of $G$ and reports accordingly (either \cref{line:G_small_enough_found_H} or \cref{line:G_small_enough_not_found_H}).

        The resulting query complexity of the algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ can bounded by
        \[
            q \leq {t \choose 2}
              \leq \Parround{ \frac{\ell \log\parround{\frac{2}{3}}}
                   {\log\parround{1 - \eta_{\ref{thm:property_testing_with_stable_partitions}}(k_*, \epsilon, \ell)}}}^2.
        \]
