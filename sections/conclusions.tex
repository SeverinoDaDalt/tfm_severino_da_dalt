\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:conclusions}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Repeat contributions from introduction (Mention appendix).
        \item We wanted to exploit the lack of irregular pairs.
        \item For testing $H$-freeness, this approach is not the best approach as
            there is Ultrastrong Ref Lemma with better exponent.
            Say that this suggests that the Stable Regularity Lemma's bound can be improved
            to something like $(1/\epsilon)^{c \cdot \delta^2}$ (suggested by Julia that it
            probably is less than it is now).
        \item The lack of irregular pairs makes the arguments easier.
        \item Future work: exploit the lack of irregular pairs to prove $H_n$-freeness
            where the size oh $H_n$ grows with $n$.
        \item Future work: exploit the lack of irregular pairs for another property, something
            like the number of copies in an interval.
    \end{itemize}
